                Hi there, nice to meet you!
            </h3>
            <p>
                My name is <b>Juliano Maciel</b> and I live with my wife and son in <b>Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brasil</b>.<br/>
                <u><b>Nowadays</b></u>, I'm using the <b>Node.js</b> stack: <b>Angular</b>, <b>Nest.js</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>Docker</b> to build Web Products that customers dream of.<br/>
                <u><b>It's awesome to use Typescript language in the Front and Backend layers of a Web App.</b></u><br/>
                <b>I'm used to work a lot with different technology stacks</b>, too. Programming languages like Python, PHP, Java, relational databases (MySQL), etc., building <b>Information Systems</b> from scratch.<br/>
                Being a <b>Craftsman</b> in <b>Frontend</b> and <b>Backend</b>.<br/>
                I'm a highly self-motivated programmer with attention to details and ability to communicate clearly and frequently (both verbally and
                in writing) and used to work in <u>fast-paced and dynamic environments</u>.<br/>
                Below, are some places I've made a huge difference on the customers day-to-day...
