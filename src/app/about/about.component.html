                <u><b>Nowadays</b></u>, I'm using the <b>Node.js</b> stack: <b>Angular</b>, <b>Nest.js</b>, <b>MongoDB</b> and <b>Docker</b>.<br/>
                <u><b>It's awesome to use Typescript language in the Front and Backend layers of a Web App.</b></u><br/>
                I've used to work a lot with different technology stacks, programming languages (PHP and Python), relational databases (MySQL), etc., building <b>Information Systems</b>, 
                being a <b>Craftsman</b> in <b>Frontend</b> and <b>Backend</b>.<br/>
                I'm a highly self-motivated programmer with attention to details and ability to communicate clearly and frequently (both verbally and
                in writing) and used to work in <u>fast-paced and dynamic environments</u>.<br/>
