                My name is <b>Juliano Maciel</b> and I live with my wife and son in <b>Florian칩polis, Santa Catarina, Brasil</b>.<br/>
                <u>Nowadays</u>, I'm working as a <b>Node.js Fullstack Web Developer</b> with great experience in <b>Angular</b> + <b>Nest.js</b> + <b>MongoDB</b> + <b>Docker</b>.
                <br/>
                In a not too distant past, I used to work with different technology stacks, programming languages (PHP, Python), etc., building <b>Information Systems</b>, 
                being a <b>Craftsman</b> in <b>Frontend</b> and <b>Backend</b>.<br/>
                I'm a highly self-motivated programmer with attention to details and ability to communicate clearly and frequently (both verbally and
                in writing) and used to work in <u>fast-paced and dynamic environments</u>.<br/>
                Below, are the last three places I've worked...
